                Hello! My name is Alex Carter, and I am the founder and lead photographer of this studio.
                With over a decade of experience, my journey into the world of photography began with a single moment of
                inspiration:
                the desire to capture the beauty of the everyday and transform it into timeless art.
                My passion lies in telling stories through my lens, focusing on the genuine emotions and authentic
                moments that make each subject unique.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/sunrise.jpg" alt="A serene landscape photo">
            <p class="caption">
                This image, taken at sunrise, embodies my love for natural light and the tranquility of landscapes. 
                I believe that capturing a scene is not just about its visual appeal, but also about the mood and feeling it evokes.

            <p class="caption">
                In this portrait, I aimed to capture the subject's personality. 
                My approach to portraits is always personal, seeking to reveal the inner character and connect with the viewer on a deeper level.
